    "# Task: Create a Grading System for Student Performance\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario:\n",
    "You are tasked with creating a simple grading system for a school. The school follows a system where students are graded based on their total score in three subjects: **Math**, **Science**, and **English**. The total score is out of 300, with each subject being out of 100. Based on the total score, students are assigned a letter grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to write a Python program that defines functions to compute the total score, calculate the average, and assign the appropriate grade based on certain conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create a function `calculate_total`:**\n",
    "   - This function should accept three parameters: `math_score`, `science_score`, and `english_score`.\n",
    "   - It should calculate and return the total score by adding these three values together.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Create a function `calculate_average`:**\n",
    "   - This function should accept the total score as a parameter.\n",
    "   - It should calculate the average by dividing the total score by 3.\n",
    "   - Return the average value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Create a function `assign_grade`:**\n",
    "   - This function should accept the average score as a parameter.\n",
    "   - Based on the average score, assign a letter grade using the following conditions:\n",
    "     - **Grade A**: Average >= 90\n",
    "     - **Grade B**: Average >= 80 but less than 90\n",
    "     - **Grade C**: Average >= 70 but less than 80\n",
    "     - **Grade D**: Average >= 60 but less than 70\n",
    "     - **Grade F**: Average < 60\n",
    "   - Return the corresponding grade as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Create a main function to bring everything together:**\n",
    "   - In the `main` function:\n",
    "     - Prompt the user to input the scores for **Math**, **Science**, and **English**.\n",
    "     - Call the `calculate_total` function to get the total score.\n",
    "     - Call the `calculate_average` function to compute the average score.\n",
    "     - Call the `assign_grade` function to assign a grade based on the average.\n",
    "     - Finally, print the total score, the average, and the assigned grade.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handle invalid inputs (optional, for advanced students):**\n",
    "   - If the user enters a score that is not between **0 and 100**:\n",
    "     - Display an error message indicating that the score is invalid.\n",
    "     - Prompt the user to enter a valid score within the range of 0 to 100.\n",
    "     - Continue prompting the user until a valid score is entered."
